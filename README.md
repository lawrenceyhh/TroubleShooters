# OOP_JAVA_TroubleShooters

This is a mini-game made by Lawrence Huang, Máté Miklós, and Joji Mathew in the course Introduction to Software Engineering (SS2021) as a team project where we went through the whole software development lifecycle from requirements elicitation, to system and object design using UML diagrams, to implementation, and, finally, to unit testing and delivery.

We built the game as a maven project in JAVA and implemented the MVC architectural pattern together with the bridge design pattern in the game.
